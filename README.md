**Question:** What unique capacity does Naval argue humans possess when it comes to understanding explanations or concepts?


## Adding your chain
To add your chain, you need to change the `load_chain` function in `main.py`.
Depending on the type of your chain, you may also need to change the inputs/outputs that occur later on.


## ðŸ’» Running Locally

1. Clone the repositoryðŸ“‚

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amjadraza/embedchain-streamlit-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and activate virtual environmentðŸ”¨

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

3. Run the Streamlit serverðŸš€

```bash
  streamlit run demo_app/main.py 
```
3.1 Run some scripts:

```bash
  python -m hugginface_demo
```

3.2 (optional) Run make:

```bash
    make all
```

possible errors
-------------------

It is possible that this exception happens:
    
    chromadb.errors.InvalidDimensionException: Embedding dimension 768 does not match collection dimensionality 1536. 
    This is commonly a side-effect when an embedding function, different from the one used to add the embeddings, 
    is used to retrieve an embedding from the database.

    Actually i dont know how to maintain both chromedb instances, so i have to some cleaning after and before running 
    hugginface script.

Run App using Docker
--------------------
This project includes `Dockerfile` to run the app in Docker container. In order to optimise the Docker Image
size and building time with cache techniques, I have follow tricks in below Article 
https://medium.com/@albertazzir/blazing-fast-python-docker-builds-with-poetry-a78a66f5aed0

Build the docker container

``docker build . -t embedchain-streamlit-app:latest ``

To generate Image with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT`, follow below command

```DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --target=runtime . -t embedchain-streamlit-app:latest```

1. Run the docker container directly 

``docker run -d --name embedchain-streamlit-app -p 8501:8501 embedchain-streamlit-app:latest ``

2. Run the docker container using docker-compose (Recommended)

``docker-compose up``


Deploy App on Streamlit Public Cloud
------------------------------------
This app can be deployed on Streamlit Public Cloud using GitHub. Below is the Link to 
Publicly deployed App
